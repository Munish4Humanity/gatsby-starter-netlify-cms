## What is OOPS?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that uses classes and objects. It’s utilized to break down a software program into reusable code blueprints (called classes) that you may use to build specific instances of things. Object-oriented programming languages include JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python, to name a few. 

Individual objects are created using class templates as a blueprint. For example, MyCar and goldenRetriever are two particular instances of the abstract class. The attributes specified in the class may have unique values for each object.  

A class is a generic template that you may use to create more specialized, concrete things. Classes are commonly used to indicate large groupings with similar characteristics. Classes may also have functions known as methods that are exclusively accessible to objects of that kind. These functions are specified inside the class and execute an action beneficial to that particular object type.
